1. Implement no clust
2. Implement single clust
3. Implement multiple clust
4. Deploy on GitHub
5. Deploy on Streamlit.io
6. Review model --> make cost of transportation dependent on flow quantity
7. CCUS hubs --> not just wells but actual hubs to be used 
8. Make it pretty




Pipelines quantity cost sources

- Global Energy Monitor (GEM) Gas Pipelines Report 2022: This report provides regional cost estimates for gas pipelines, with Europe averaging approximately $2.98 million per kilometer. 
- Oil and Gas Journal: Reports from 2015–2016 indicate that U.S. onshore gas pipelines cost around $4.75 million per kilometer.
