The simulations give high confidence that ""industrial scale"" injection (>1Mt/a & storage resource of 40-200Mt) can be achieved by using a combination of injection horizons.

Study 1: Based on 2D seismic & logs from 1960-70's, models were created from these which supported Migration assisted trapping for CO2 storage. Study 2: More 2D seismic acquired & Harvey 1 well was drilled deep down to the Sabina Sandstone, this study raised injectivity uncertainty concerns. Study 3: Uncertainty management plan (UMP) created, They acquired 3D seismic covering the study area and drilled 3 new wells (Harvey 2, 3 & 4). This new data was used to get a better understanding of interbedding of sand and minor paleosol layers and containment of shallower horizons ","The results of all static and dynamic models are consistent with injecting 800,000 t/a over 30 years in the Wonnerup member, this would require injecting over 9 separate wells. The CO2 emissions sources would be the industrial hubs of Kwinana, Kemerton and Collie. ","The following has been modelling using both static and dynamic modelling. The CO2 is to be injected into the bottom of the Wonnerup member, part of  the Leseuer sandstone. From here it is predicted to be held by migration assisted trapping MAT (combination of dissolution and residual trapping) as it rises up through the Wonnerup member and into the Yalgorup member (upper Leseuer). The Yalgorup member consisted of  sandstone with minor interbeds of paleosols with limited lateral continuity (point bar deposits), these will help trapping by MAT. Above the Yalgorup member is the Eneaba formation which has a basal shale which will act as the upper confining layers. however the Eneaba formation is not continuous over the entire Yolgorup member, therefore leaks could be possible. This is why plume migration modelling is so important here. ","Discovered: There is a lot of data for this sight: 3 generations of seismic data acquisition (2D and 3D), and 4 wells drilled into the storage formation (1 deep and 3 shallow).

International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, IJGGC_103959.","Notional project aimed at determining storage potential of lowermost aquifer system in Williston Basins covering Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba in Canada. This aquifer consists mainly of Cambrian shallow-marine sandstones and an extension of Ordovician carbonates.



","The notional project targets a regional pressurisation of 30% to be reached in 50 years. Three development plans are defined to inject 1U, 2U and 3U. These scenerios are defined by geological uncertainties which translates in varying porosity and permeability. The 1U scenario requires 825 wells to inject 18.6Gt, the 2U scenario requires 600 wells to inject 24.6Gt, the 3U scenario requires 422 wells to inject 32.0Gt. In all scenarios no extraction of water is considered. ","COSS is overlain  by a shaly caprock composed of fine-grained siliciclastic of the Deadwood formation. The
presence of salt formations in the overburden and the pressure disconnection to shallower aquifers leads to considering the cap rock as
impermeable.

","In the article the authors consider the resources as Prospective within the SRMS framework. Capacities and contingent resources associated to the current CO2 storage projects are not reviewed in the publication.

The field is located in Indonesia's most northerly territory, in the South China Sea . The Natuna discovery is southeast Asia's largest undeveloped gas discovery, with estimated resource of 46 Tcf of recoverable methane.  The field has not been developed yet as the gas within is composed of ~80%  CO2 which is far greater than the specification for gas sales. Therefore to develop this field, a Carbon storage formation is needed. This study outlines the details of this potential project. ","A simple simulation was conducted to determine the maximum rate of CO2 that can be injected over the injection period without the pressure in the reservoir exceeding its fracture pressure. Sensitivities were carried out on the number of wells required. The volume of CO2 modeled was based on production modelling. The plan is for the cumulative gas stream to be piped to Great Natuna Island where the CO2 will be separated from the stream by membrane. The CO2 will then be piped 200km offshore near to the Natuna Gas field where it will be injected into the Terumbu formation which runs below the Gas discovery.

The reservoir rock is platform and reefal carbonate build-ups that are surrounded by tight fine grained carbonates and shales. These surrounding carbonates and shales will mean the reservoir is confined on either side and the lithology of the reservoir will give very low lateral continuity. There is no mention of the sealing formation. It is estimated that around 90 wells will be needed for injection due to complex geology of the reservoir. Although a simple simulation has been conducted, no simulation modeling has been carried out to understand possible migration of injected CO2 into the structure as the gas field is produced. The permeability of 250mD, however, may provide a containment challenge, where injected CO2 migrates up-dip into the depleting field.","Undiscovered: Inaccessible.

Malaysia's CO2 emissions have been increasing by 1.9% a year, from 20.9 Gt in 1990 to 32.3 Gt in 2013, and it is expected to keep rising as Malaysia undergoes rapid economic development. Malaysia has a good selection of sedimentary basins, some of which are already used for oil and gas production, therefore using these for CO2 geological storage could help Malaysia decrease their emissions. In this paper 14 papers are assessed and put through a spreadsheet which assesses them on several different qualities needed for CO2 storage. From this process only 2 basins are chosen for detailed assessment of storage resource. "," Figure 7 gives injection sequence and shows potential injection wells (existing exploration wells) no aerial location is given for these wells however. It is noted that the area has existing infrastructure that is used for oil and gas but there is no mention of a potential source of CO2 for this storage site. It is also noted that there is a large amount of relevant data on the area, but no mention on specifically what type of data (well logs or seismic data), more of this may be needed before this storage resource can be developed. ","The late Miocene unconformity is the proposed lateral sealing formation, there is no mention of its lithology. From the Cross section this unconformity looks to be erosional and causes the group E & D reservoir to pinch off to the SW and NE as shown in cross section, this may provide a degree lateral confinement. There is a large number of faults that are present throughout the basin, some cut through the unconformity. It is said that most of these have sealing properties, however there is no mention of the compartmentalization that these would cause in the reservoir - this would drastically inhibit lateral migration of CO2.","Undiscovered: inaccessible.

Discovered because these resource estimates were made using cumulative replacement volumes for both produced and proven reserves in the basin. Inaccessible because Thailand does not have any specific CCS policies or regulations. This site entry represents cumulative replacement volumes of produced and proven reserves from oil and gas fields in this basin - it does not account for any aquifer pore volumes. Specifically, these replacement volumes were calculated by converting Gas STP volumes to equivalent CO2 Tonnage stored (1Tcf = ~80Mt CO2), this result is then multiplied by density of CO2. To convert OIL STP volumes to equivalent CO2 tonnage stored, a pressure of 10.5 MPa/km and geothermal gradients of 30-35๐ C/km were used. The density of CO2 between 1,500-4,000 meters deep in the subsurface is about 700 kg/m3, and the FVF was assumed to be 1.2.",,2017,Cycle 3,AW,,,,,,,,,,,200.0,,Unknown - calculated using replacment volume,Not specified ,,,,O&G Replacement volume,Assessed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33.42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,33.42,0.0,0.0,33420000.0,0.0,,Undifferentiated,NO,,1.0

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED ENGINEERING , 12.","This paper realises the problems of global warming and Thailand's commitment to reduce emissions by 140Mt by 2030. The country has increasing electricity demand to drive the growing economy (in 2014 70% electricity from fossil fuels ). The Power Development Plan (2015) mentions that the Songkhla province southern Thailand is forecast to experience a considerable increase in electricity demand. The Department of Mineral Fuels, under the Ministry of energy is the responsible government agency for CCS in Thailand. In this study, daily injection rates and volumes are based on that of the nearby Chana Powerplant (1500MW/Year Capacity) from 01 September 2014 - 01 August 2017. it is also noted that the reservoirs within this AOI can support a clean coal project with 200MW/year capacity in the near future. ",Daily injectivity dynamic simulations is based off that of the Chana power plant from 2014 - 2017. The formation pressure in the simulation has been set to not exceed the initial pressure of 224 Bar. Well A (an existing well) has been chosen for injection as it penetrates the area of highest porosity in the static model. Injection is simulated for  3 years.  the Bua-Ban field is 50km north of CO2 emissions from the Chana power plant. ,"the static geo model accounts for primary porosity (deposition and lithification) and secondary porosity (fracturing & jointing) based on geological setting and geophysical data. The simulation shows the  CO2 plume will migrate updip to the west after injection, the plume appears to cross a permeable  fault zone. No mention is given about the seal rock. ","Discovered: Inaccessible. Discovered as there are more wells than needed within the AOI in order for it to be 100% discovered, the Bua-Ban field which contains modelled blocks SLO and SLM, the AOI covers an area of  ~280km^2. The resource is inaccessible because Thailand does not have any specific CCS policies or regulations. A static model was created on Petrel using data from 164 well logs in the area and local geophysical data. The dynamic simulation was run in Eclipse Ver. 2017, injection rate matched the volumes emitted by the Chana powerplant (2014-2017) and the pressure limit was set at 224 Bar.

Therefore this paper presents storage options and development plans for the CO2 from these high CO2 fields. ","A simple simulation was conducted to determine the maximum rate of CO2 that can be injected over the injection period (20 years) without the pressure in the reservoir exceeding its fracture pressure. Sensitivities were carried out on the number of wells required. The volume of CO2 modelled was based on production modelling. The analyses implicitly assume injection sites with the reservoir properties assumed for the sedimentary basin where they are located.CO2 injected into saline formation underneath the CO2-rich gas field. Steel Jacket platform, 3 deviated wells injecting a total of 3.5Mt/y, 10km 850mm pipeline with 3MW of compression.","The development plan proposes injection into the same unit (L Group) as the high-CO2 gas field. Although a simple simulation has been conducted, no simulation modelling has been carried out to understand possible migration of injected CO2 into the structure as the gas field is produced. The permeability of 500mD, however, may provide a containment challenge, where injected CO2 migrates into the depleting field.","Undiscovered, Inaccessible.

However the dynamic simulations modelled injection based on six wells placed in the deepest part of the aquifer injecting 0.5Mt/yr in two wells and 1Mt/yr in 4 wells. Included in this were five water producer wells. ,A clean carbonate quartz arenite with thin scattered layers of shale and siltone that is in an open/semi closed aquifer. Trapping is mainly stratigraphic and the entire formation has a wedge shaped depositions that gently dips towards the south east and pinches out in the north west. This formation continues towards Lithuania and Poland. The Aquifer is capped by a multi seal of a thick sequence of Ordovician carbonates and a thin layer of Alum Shale with variable continuity. The Ordovian sequences are capped further by a thick layer of Silurian Marlstone.,The dynamic simulations of both 500Mt over 100 years and 250Mt over 50 years showed containment within the aquifer however the area of this study did not include the eastern and south-easternmost parts and the Dalders Structure so this study may result in less than the Volumetric method  based on the DOE storage efficiency factor for formations of 745 Mt cited in the NORDICCS CO2 Atlas . Limitations in the dynamic study are from data sparsity which may increase the uncertainties in capacity. Only two wells exist in this formation. An area of approx. 300Km2 is therefore classified as partly discovered. The remaining area is covered by the dynamic simulation and hence this site is partially discovered.  Note: The area of this dynamic simulation does not cover the full Faludden Formation aquifer and neither does the source state the areal extent of the simulation therefore it is not possible to subtract this from the full aquifer site. Hence the full aquifer will continue to have some capacity although it is  not possible to calculate  from the data available. A ball park figure would estimate that around 245Mt may remain outside of  the dynamic simulation area based on the volumetric calculation of 745Mt for the full Faludden aquifer from the NORDICCS Storage Atlas assessment.

It is an open and partly faulted aquifer with regional distribution and contains no traps or closures. The area suitable for CO2 storage is in the south-west from the Romeleasen Fault Zone. The seal is the Hollviken Formation comprised of a thick sequence of argillaceous limestone and chalk.,"The dynamic simulations in the source study, ran a maximum of  400Mt over 100 years with a rate of 1Mt/yr in each of the four wells. 14% of the CO2 migrated to depths less than 800M over a simulation of 6000 years.  Limited data reduces the accuracy of this study . There is some ambiguity over volumes from this source and the NORDICCS Atlas which also cites a modelled volume of 225 Mt.. Wells do exist on the site, and cover around 50%  and relatively evenly distributed. Neither is  possible to define how many wells penetrate the formations. 50% of The site is therefore classified as discovered due the dynamic simulation and well coverage and covered under  separate record.

This includes the Prinos and Epsilon Fields and the underlying aquifer.  The project aims to contribute to local and regional decarbonisation with transport lines planned by both ship and pipeline.,Internal and external studied have show the field can hold up to 3Mtpa of CO2 for 25 years. A phase 1 plan is to inject 1 Mt per year as compressed gas and then expand to liquid form by mid-2027. The second phase is to inject 3 Mt per year for 25 years. ,"The Prinos field and Aquifer are overlain by a thick sequence of evaporites, clastics and marls up to 2300m thick. Overall thickness of sediment in the basin is over 6km. The sites are in a fault controlled rift basin and characterised by high strike-slip faults. The overall basin appears tectonically stable although the Aegean region has more than 60% of European seismicity released in the area. The existence of the oil fields and fault bound trips indicates that the Prinos area experiences very limited seismicity.","Extensive work has been conducted on the area by Energean but not available in the public domain.

IFP, Vol. 65 (2010), No. 3, pp. 375-403 the Dogger has a storage efficiency  of around 2%. This is based on 3D numerical modelling injecting 0.6 Mt CO2 over 4 years. The modelling was pilot scale only. Assessment by Bader et al  (2014) Energy Procedia 63 ( 2014 ) 2779 – 2788 did consider the Dogger for numerical  modelling to understand capacity, but was rejected due to risk of overpressure that would impact geothermal activity and high permeability.

Injection to the west of the Marne Fault  may avoid this but the reservoir properties start to become less favourable and hence injection volumes are less on the west side.," The GeoCapacity project (2006-2009) provided a value of 17640 for all the Bundsandstein in the Paris Basin using an over estimated SE of 6%.  During the France Nord project the  Keuper was assessed on 2 sites: Keuper Nord and Keuper Sud along with the Buntdsandstein over an area of 220,000 km2. Cases were run with 21 wells  and 23 wells to the east and wells of Faille de la Marne respectively.  The  results indicated a capacity of 157 Mt for  east and west of Faille de la Marne and 87 Mt for west of Faille de la Marne. The results indicate that the high SE as reported in GESTCO and GeoCapacity do not apply and overpressure in the main issue with large injection volumes for saine aquifers.

This seal has successfully contained natural gas for approximately 200 million years, indicating its capability to securely store gases for extended periods. ","The In Salah CO2 Storage project has provided crucial insights into carbon storage processes, emphasizing the integration of monitoring into routine field operations and field development plans. The project highlighted the effectiveness of combining standard oilfield techniques with geotechnical and environmental monitoring practices, including the use of satellite InSAR data to understand geomechanical responses to CO2 injection. These methods, along with detailed reservoir and overburden data, are essential for assessing site-specific leakage risks and adapting operations as necessary.
